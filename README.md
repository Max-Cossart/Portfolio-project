# Portfolio Project

## Demo

You can find the live version of this project [Here](https://max-cossart-portfolio.vercel.app/)

## Requirements & Purpose

### MVP

- Build a portfolio which portrayed who I am and a bit about me
- Use Scss and B.E.M naming conventions

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript (soon)

## Build Steps

- Download and install node.js
- Install Sass:

  ```bash
  npm install -g sass
  ```

## Design Goals

- The goal with the design was to keep it minimalistic with colors that are pleasing to the eye, whilst also showing off some of what I know.
-

## Features

- This Project has the following features:
  - This is a single page webpage, so there is no refreshing.
  - There is a hover effect on each of the projects. When hovered a overlay slides up and displays some info about the projects.
  - The Tech Stack section of the project also has a hover effect show the name below when the stack is hovered.

## Known Issues

- I feel the hover effects are a little janky on mobile devices. I would like to come up with some that still has a great UI and clean feel when on mobile.
- There currently isn't a hamburger menu when on mobile which is something I would like to implement.
- I need to change out the place holders for projects!!

## Future Goals

- I would like to rebuild this in React(possibly Next for some additional practice) so there is less repeated code.

# Struggles

- I do not consider myself a designer at all, so coming up with something that I liked took me a lot longer than I care to admit.
- Being my first attempt at Scss it came with a set of challenges, I am glad to say that after this I have fallen in love with Scss.
